Consider the following code: 

class MyRunnable implements Runnable
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		new Thread( new MyRunnable(2) ).start();
	}
	public void run(int n)
	{
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
		{
			System.out.println("Hello World");
		}
	}
}
What will be the output when this program is compiled and run from the command line? 
Select 1 correct option. 
a  It'll  print "Hello World" once.   
b  It'll print "Hello World" twice.   
c  This program will not even compile.   
d  This will compile but will throw an exception at runtime.   
e  It will compile and run but it will not print anything.
