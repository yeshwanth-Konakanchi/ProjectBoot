Consider the following code: 

class MyClass implements Runnable
{
	int n = 0;
	public MyClass(int n){ this.n = n; }
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		new MyClass(2).run();
		new MyClass(1).run();
	}
	public void run()
	{
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
		{
			System.out.println("Hello World");
		}
	}
}
