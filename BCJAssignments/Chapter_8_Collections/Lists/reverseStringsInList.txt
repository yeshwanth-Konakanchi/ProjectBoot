Write a method reverseList  that takes an ArrayList of Strings as a parameter and that reverses every element.

For example, if the list stores the values 
{"how", "are", "you?"}

 before the method is called, it should store the values 
{"woh", "era", "uoy"}

 after the method finishes executing.
 
Always, write junit test method for every assignment.
