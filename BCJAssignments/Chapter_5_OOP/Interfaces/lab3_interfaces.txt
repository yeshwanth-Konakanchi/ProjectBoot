Create a class hierarchy for Mammals using Mammal as an interface.

Create interfaces for LandMammal and WaterMammal (eg. whale).

Create Concrete classes that implement LandMammal and WaterMammal classes.

Example of Concrete class that implements from LandMammal are Lion, HumanBeing, etc.
Example of Concrete class that implements from WaterMammal is Whale.

Declare abstract methods like swim for WaterMammal and walk, run, crawl for LandMammals.

Feel free to create your own class hierarchy, abstract methods and concrete methods here.

Show in a main method how to create the objects of the concrete classes using
Interfaces as the data types.

Implmentations of the run, swim or walk methods can just have simple print statments.
