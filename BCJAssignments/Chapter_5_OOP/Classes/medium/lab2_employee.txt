Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as 
instance variables—a first name (type String), a last name (type String) and a
monthly salary (double). Your class should have a constructor that initializes 
the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable.
If the monthly salary is not positive, set it to 0.0. 

Write a demo application named EmployeeDemo that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities.
Create two Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary. 
Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again.
