Take an object of classA which inherits from classC and classA 
contains an instance of classB. classA has instance variable int i,and 
classC has a instance variable String s;Make classA serializable but dont 
make classB and classC seriazlizable.classB has an instance variable long l; 
and classA has a transient instance variable int j;if you serialize a 
and store it as bytes check if it throws an exception; after serializing it 
deserialize the bytes in the first program and verify and print the contents
of class A,B,C. and see that the transient variable have the value of zero.
