Consider the following two classes:

public class Car {
    public void m1() {
        System.out.println("car 1");
    }

    public void m2() {
        System.out.println("car 2");
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "vroom";
    }
}

public class Truck extends Car {
    public void m1() {
        System.out.println("truck 1");
    }
}

And assuming that the following variables have been declared:

Car mycar = new Car();
Truck mytruck = new Truck();

What is the output from the following statements?

System.out.println(mycar);	
mycar.m1();	
mycar.m2();	
System.out.println(mytruck);	
mytruck.m1();	
mytruck.m2();
