Help to solve this problem
--------------------------

In java, the \ character is an escape character.
It is used to escape from the normal interpretation of the character following it.

So to print \ itself, we need to escape it by using the \ character before it.

Similarly, the " character denotes the start or the end of a string.

To print the " character, we need to put a \ before the " character.
