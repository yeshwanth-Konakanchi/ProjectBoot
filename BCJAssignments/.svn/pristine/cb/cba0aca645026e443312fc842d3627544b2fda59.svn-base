Create a class called MyDate that includes three pieces of information as instance 
variables—a month (type int), a day (type int) and a year (type int).

Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three instance variables 
and assumes that the values provided are correct. Provide a set and a get method for 
each instance variable. 

Provide a method displayDate that displays the month, day and year separated by 
forward slashes (/). 

Write a demo application named DateDemo that demonstrates class Date’s capabilities.
