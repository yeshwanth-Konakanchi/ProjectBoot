Create a file called Sorting.java. Copy and paste the following program into it:

import java.util.*;

class Sorting {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int listSize = 30;
    int magnitude = 500;
    Random rand = new Random(12345);
    
	ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(listSize);
    for (int i=0; i < listSize; i++) {
      numbers.add(rand.nextInt() % magnitude);
	}
    
	Collections.sort(numbers);
    
	for (Integer num : numbers) {
      System.out.print(num + " ");
	}
    System.out.println();
  }
}

Look through the documentation for the class Collections. Specifically, find the method sort, 
and notice that there is another version of it that takes a Comparator object.

(b) Add a class to the top of the file called BackwardOrdering that implements the Comparator
 interface such that integers are ordered in reverse from their usual ordering. 
 The following line of code should then sort the integers in reverse order:
    Collections.sort(numbers, new BackwardOrdering());
	
Add this line of code to the bottom of your program, then add a copy of the loop to print
 out the numbers again.

(c) Add a class to the top of the file called AlternatingOrdering that implements the Comparator
 interface such even that positive numbers are ordered as usual, but negative numbers are ordered
 in reverse. All positive numbers (and zero) are larger than all negative numbers. Add more code 
 to the main method to sort the numbers by this wacky method using Collections.sort, 
  then print out the results.
