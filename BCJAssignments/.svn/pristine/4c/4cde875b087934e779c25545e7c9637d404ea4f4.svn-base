Write a method reverseOddAndEvenList  that takes an ArrayList of Strings as a parameter 
and that reverses elements at odd positions with the elements at the even positions.

For example, if the list stores the values 

{"how", "are", "you?", "I", "am", "doing", "fine"}

 before the method is called, it should store the values 

{"are", "how", "I", "you?", "doing", "am", "fine"}

 after the method finishes executing.
 
Always, write junit test method for every assignment.
