Draw an inheritance hierarchy for students at a university.

Use Student as the superclass of the hierarchy, then extend Student with classes such as 
Under-graduateStudent and GraduateStudent. Continue to extend the hierarchy as deep 
(i.e., as many levels) as possible.

For example, Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior might extend UndergraduateStudent
and DoctoralStudent and MastersStudent might be subclasses of GraduateStudent.

1) Write code for each of the classes in the above inheritance hierarchy, including valid
   constructors, setters and getters & some validation methods or any other useful methods.

2) Write a demo program that illustrates the "is-a" relationship when creating objects.
