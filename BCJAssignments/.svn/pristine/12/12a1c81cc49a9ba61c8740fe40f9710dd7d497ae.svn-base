A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. 

The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. 

For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of merchandise in a week receives
$200 plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650.

You have been supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. 

The values of these items are as follows:

Item   Value
-------------
1      239.99
2      129.75
3       99.95
4      350.89

Develop a Java application that inputs one salesperson’s items sold for last week and calculates
and displays that salesperson’s earnings. There is no limit to the number of items that
can be sold by a salesperson.
