     * Logic:
     * 
     * Read the first command line argument which is args[0]
     * convert args[0] to a lowercase string so that we only have to
     * check for lowercase vowels.
     * 
     * Now we want to check whether this lower case string contains any
     * of the lower case vowels or not.
     * 
     * Iterate over all the characters of this string using a for loop
     * Inside the loop, get the character at the current loop index position
     * we have to check whether that character is a vowel.
     * 
     * If you find a vowel, stop iterating over the loop and print that the 
     * string contains a vowel.
     * 
     * If you don't find a vowel after the loop ends, then 
     * print that the string DOES NOT contain a vowel.
     * 
     * Hints for the logic:
     * 
     * String class has a method called charAt(int)
     * Length of the string can found using the length() method of the string
     * iterate from loop index of 0 upto length-1
     * inside the loop use charAt to get the character at each position
     * and compare that the character is 'a', or 'e', or 'i', or 'o' or 'u'
     * The logical operator "or" is ||
     *
