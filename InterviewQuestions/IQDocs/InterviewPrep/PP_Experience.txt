Pair Programming:
In pair programming, there are 2 developers working on the same enhancement or feature on the
same computer at the same time.

One will be on keyboard and other one is helping him.

It is like a journey where 2 friends are driving in a car &
they want to go from point A to point B.

One friend is the DRIVER and the other is the NAVIGATOR.

In PP, the driver is controlling the KVM (keyboard, Video & Mouse). 
The navigator monitors what the driver is doing and provides suggestions to improve
the code.

After every 30 minutes, the driver & the navigator trade places.

Advantages:
1) It reduces the overall time taken for coding with better quality.
2) Coding and reviewing the code happens at the same time.
  -naming conventions, coding conventions, testability 
   of code & other metrics which improve the quality of the code.

Disadvantges:
1) It could be a possibility that they do not agree on the same point & each wants to do it
   his own way. In that case, they should seek resolution from the tech lead or architect.
