"Hi, My name is Rizwan.

I have been working as a java developer for about 7 years.

My primary strengths are in java development using Core Java

& the associated frameworks & tools in the java eco system.

On the backend I have worked with core java, spring, hibernate, 

SOAP based web services & restful services.

On the frontend I have used MVC frameworks like spring mvc, struts,

javascript, ajax using jquery.

I have worked with both the Waterfall & Agile methodologies.

I have participated in Scrum iteration planning and our sprints were for

3-4 weeks & extreme Programming practices like TDD and CI.
