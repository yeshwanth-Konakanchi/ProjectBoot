1) Agile project management is an iterative approach to planning and guiding project processes.
2) Agile is based on Sprint Planning, Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review + Shippable Product and Sprint Retrospective.
3) In Scrum team, there is Product Owner, Scrum Master and the Team.
4) In the sprint planning meeting, the product owner describes the highest priority features to the entire team. The team asks enough questions that they can turn a high-level user story of the product backlog into the more detailed tasks of the sprint backlog.

	-	there is the list of all desired features, can contain bugs.
	-	maintain and prioritize by product owner
	-	Items can be added by anyone.

	-	there is a to-do list for the sprint meeting. 
	-	created by the scrum team.
	-	prioritize by the product owner.
	- there is task board, which is visible to everyone.
