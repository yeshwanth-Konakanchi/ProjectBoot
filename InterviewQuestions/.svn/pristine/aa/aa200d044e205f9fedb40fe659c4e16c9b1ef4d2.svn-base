Have worked in developing web and enterprise applications using  Java
, the associated frameworks & tools in the java eco system.

 along with HTML, CSS, JSP, javascript, ajax and jquery.

On the backend I have worked with core java, spring, hibernate, 
SOAP based web services & restful services. I have used different
modules of spring like spring-core, spring-jdbc, spring-orm, spring-mvc,
