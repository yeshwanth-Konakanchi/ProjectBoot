I have used TDD in some of my projects where we did development from scratch.

In TDD, you start writing interfaces and then create test cases first
using method stubs as dummy implementations.

Initially all the tests fail.

Now go and add code to make all the tests pass.

In projects where the code was already there & I had to do enhancements,
there are 2 approaches.

1) Edit & Pray - You modify code and pray that everything works and you
   have not broken existing functionality.

2) First check the code test coverage of the existing code & then
   add more junit tests to get good test coverage.
   After that, you make code changes for the enhancements or bug fixes
   and make sure that all the tests pass.
